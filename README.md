# Advent of Code 2022

My personal repository for my solutions of the [Advent of Code 2022](https://adventofcode.com/). I'm
trying to solve them using modern C++, mostly relying on range-v3.

### Build

Run the following commands once this repository is checked out:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/ericniebler/range-v3.git external/range-v3
git clone https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt.git external/fmt
mkdir build && cd build
cmake ..
make
```
